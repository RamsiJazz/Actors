        <p>Muhammad Kutty Panaparambil Ismail (Malayalam: [muhɐmːɐd̪ kuʈːi pɐnɐpːɐrɐmbil ismɐi̯l]; born 7 September 1951), known mononymously by the hypocorism Mammootty ([mɐmːuːʈːi]), is an Indian actor and film producer who works predominantly in Malayalam and Tamil language films. He has also appeared in Telugu, Kannada, Hindi, and English-language productions. In a career spanning five decades, he has acted in more than 400 films. He is the recipient of several accolades, including three National Film Awards, eight Kerala State Film Awards, eleven Kerala Film Critics Awards and thirteen Filmfare Awards South. For his contribution to film, the Government of India awarded him the Padma Shri in 1998. In 2022, he was honoured with Kerala Prabha Award, the second-highest honour given by the Government of Kerala.</p>
        <p>Mammootty made his debut in acting through Malayalam film Anubhavangal Paalichakal in 1971. His first leading role was in I. V. Sasi's unreleased film Devalokam (1979). Mammootty's breakthrough came in 1981 when he received the Kerala State Film Award for Second Best Actor for his performance in Ahimsa. Major commercial successes during this time included the 1983 films Sandhyakku Virinja Poovu and Aa Raathri. Following a series of box office failures, the 1987 crime thriller New Delhi improved his commercial prospects. The films that followed through the next decade established Mammootty as one of the leading stars of Malayalam cinema.</p>
